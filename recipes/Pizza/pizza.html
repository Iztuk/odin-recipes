    <p>Pizza is a crowd-pleasing choice for busy weeknights and fun weekend dinners alike. 
        But you don't have to rely on restaurants or takeout for top-notch pizza. 
        Read on for tips on how to make your own pizza at home. 
        We'll walk you through how to make pizza crust, how to top a pizza, pizza baking temperature, and how long to bake pizza.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pizza crust</strong>: Let's start with the base, the crispy crust that holds it all together. With the crust, you can go a few ways: You can make homemade pizza with store-bought dough; use pre-baked crusts (such as Boboli) or even English muffins and pita bread for personal pizzas; or make your own pizza dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Pizza sauce</strong>: Now for the sauce. There are loads of delicious pre-made marinara sauces for pizza sauce. We have oodles of homemade pizza sauce recipes, too. Beyond red pizza sauces, don't forget pesto sauces, white sauces, or even a simple olive oil and garlic sauce. They will expand your pizza potential by almost infinite proportions.</li>
        <li><strong>Pizza toppings</strong>: There's almost no limit to the toppings you can pile on a pizza. Tomato sauce and pepperoni you know. But apples and walnuts? For sure. Fresh figs and prosciutto? Of course! Sweet corn and peas? Well, in Europe and Japan, corn and peas are common pizza toppings. Bottom line, pizza is open to an infinite amount of creativity where toppings are concerned.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven.</li>
        <li>Form the pizza dough and place it on a peel dusted with a little flour or cornmeal.</li>
        <li>Slip the pizza onto the hot pizza stone.</li>
        <li>After 5 minutes of baking, check the pizza.</li>
        <li>The pizza is done when the cheese is melted to a medium-to-dark brown.</li>
    </ol>
